Pollutants may include almost any natural or artificial composition of airborne matter capable of being airborne. They may be in the form of solid particles, liquid droplets, gases, or in combination thereof. Exclusive of pollen, fog, and dust, which are of natural origin, about 100 contaminants have been identified. Air pollutants are often grouped in categories for ease in classification; some of the categories are: solids, sulfur compounds, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter, nitrogen compounds, oxygen compounds, halogen compounds, radioactive compound, and odours.</p>

 	      <dd><p>A  degradable material is one that breaks down in such a way that the resulting  materials can be easily assimilated into the environment, without having any  significant negative impact on the environment. While many materials are  ultimately degradable, the conditions under which these materials are disposed  of may hinder the degradation process. Generally, light must be present for a  good to photodegrade, while biological degradation requires oxygen to be  present. Neither light nor oxygen is readily available in conventional  landfills. Therefore, a supplier&rsquo;s claim of degradability only has value if the  disposal conditions are appropriate for degradation to occur. Furthermore, if a  good is only partly degradable, those ingredients that are identified as  degradable should comprise a significant part of the good. </p>
          <p>For a claim of compostability to be made, further criteria  must be met; it must be able to break down into carbon dioxide, water and  biomass at the same rate as paper, should not produce any toxic material and  should be able to support plant life.</p>
          <p>Suppliers should cite specific standards when making claims  of degradability, biodegradability or compostability. The American Society for  Testing Materials (ASTM) and Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD) publish degradability standards for a range of materiel,  including plastics and chemicals. </p></dd>

        <dd><p>Durable means a good is useful for a long period by  resisting wear, decay, etc. Durable goods are environmentally preferred, in  principle, because they can be reused or upgraded, helping keep resources out  of a landfill and reducing the use of raw materials. However, there are no set  criteria for durability as a green procurement term. When a supplier claims  that a good is more durable compared to competitors, ask for further  information, such as the expected lifetime of the good, options for reuse  and/or upgrade, and availability of replaceable parts that prevent disposal in  the event of a breakdown. </p></dd>

The same is true for terms such as &lsquo;environmentally responsible&rsquo;, &lsquo;natural&rsquo;, or &lsquo;green&rsquo;.<strong> </strong>As a result, this claim can be meaningless, unless  specific environmental standards are cited.

The  greenhouse gases include gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane  (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrochlorofluorocarbons  (HCFCs), ozone (O3), perfluorinated carbons (PFCs), and  hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Emissions of these gases in the atmosphere are  caused by a number of things, including the burning of fossil fuels (e.g. oil,  gas, coal, etc.) and the release of some manmade chemicals. Reduction in  emissions of these gases is being targeted to reduce the effects of climate  change.</p>

Two common Canadian references to hazardous materials can be found in the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) and the <em>Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act</em>. Industrial suppliers must provide Material  Safety Data Sheets (MSDS),<strong> </strong>which provide information regarding  the risks of using a product and precautions to be taken to safely use, store  and dispose of such products. </p>
              <p>The <em>Hazardous Products Act</em> and the <em>Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act</em> regulate the labelling of consumer products, for use in both industrial  settings and by consumer households. Consumer products that can pose a safety  risk are marked as being flammable, corrosive, poisonous, explosive, etc.</p>

              <p>The International  Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies. The  ISO 14001 standard is being used by  organizations around the world to develop Environmental Management Systems  (EMS). An EMS provides a  framework for managing environmental responsibilities efficiently and supports  their integration into overall business operations. An  organization may simply base their EMS on the standard or it may choose to  become officially registered to the standard, in which case it must  periodically undergo audits by an ISO 14001 registrar. The establishment and registration of an EMS to ISO 14001 demonstrates that a company has  procedures for monitoring and complying with regulatory requirements, exercises  due diligence with respect to environmental risks and is continually improving  their environmental performance. </p>
              <p>ISO  14020 to 14024 eco-labelling standards address product labelling, environmental  claims made by suppliers, and the standardization of environmental terminology.</p>

              <p>The <em>Canadian  Environmental Protection Act</em>, 1999 (CEPA, 1999) defines a substance as toxic if it is entering or may enter the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that:</p>
                <ol>
                	<li>have or may have an immediate or long-term harmful effect on the environment or its biological diversity;</li>
                	<li>constitute or may constitute a danger to the environment on which life depends; or</li>
                	<li>constitute or may constitute a danger in Canada to human life or health.</li>
                </ol>
	            <p>The likelihood and magnitude of releases into the  environment and the harm it may cause are taken into account. The Minister of  the Environment and the Minister of Health are jointly responsible for the  Priority Substances List, which is a list of substances to assess to determine  if they are &quot;toxic&quot; or capable of becoming &quot;toxic&quot;. </p>
              <p>Substances that are found to be toxic are then added to the <a href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/lcpe-cepa/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=0DA2924D-1" target="_blank" title="link opens in new window">CEPA  List of Toxic Substances</a>. The federal government then works with the  provinces, territories, industry, non-government organizations and other  interested parties to develop a management plan to reduce or eliminate the  harmful effects the substance has on the environment and the health of Canadians. This may include the introduction of regulations that prohibit  activities or impose specific duties, including duties to those in possession of the substance and who use products containing the substance. </p>
              <p>There is little value or consistency to a &lsquo;non-toxic&rsquo; label,  unless backed up by a certification. The certification standards cited should  be reviewed to better understand the meaning of the &lsquo;non-toxic&rsquo; claim. </p>

              <p>Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) change rapidly  from a liquid state to a gaseous state when exposed to air. VOC vapours react with oxides of nitrogen in the presence of sunlight to produce low level ozone, an air pollutant and a contributor to smog.  Indoors, VOCs can adversely impact indoor air  quality, a measurement of the quality of air in a particular building based on the concentration of chemicals, particulates and other elements harmful to  human health. Sources of VOCs include off-gassing from furniture, carpets, printers, cleaning products, markers and paint fumes. </p>
