It may also be needed if there is a change in position requirements.</p><p>A decision to deny or revoke a security screening level would mean that an individual would no longer meet the conditions of employment and their employment would be negatively impacted. In such cases a review for cause must be conducted.</p><p>Individuals must be given an opportunity to explain adverse information before a decision to deny or revoke is reached and must be informed in writing of their rights of access to review or redress mechanisms.</p></div>
