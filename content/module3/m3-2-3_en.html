Individuals must be given an opportunity to explain adverse information before a decision is reached. They must also be informed in writing of their rights of access to review or redress mechanisms where a decision to deny or revoke reliability status or a security clearance has been reached.</p><p>An individual may have his security clearance denied or revoked if he is deemed to be a threat to the security of Canada.</p><p>Since a reliability status or security clearance is a condition of employment, a denial or revocation could severely impact the future employability of the individual within the federal government.</p></div>
