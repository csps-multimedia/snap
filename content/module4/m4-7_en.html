A zone is characterized by who has access to the area, the level of security screening of the personnel, and the requirements for handling and storage of sensitive information within that area.</p><p>Zones are an effective way of controlling access to the sensitive information and assets. They are nested to provide increased levels of security.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>When information transitions from one zone to another, the inherent security may not be sufficient and additional security measures are required.</p></div>
