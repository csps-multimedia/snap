	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-2"><p>It is not uncommon to encounter unfamiliar individuals throughout your workday. Sometimes these strangers are employees you have never seen before or they are new to the department. Other times they are authorized visitors, contractors or people with legitimate reasons for being there.</p><p><strong>Key Message</strong></p><p>It is the duty of all employees, at all times, to be vigilant and to take appropriate action if they see strangers in or near all restricted-zones.</p><h3>Considerations</h3><p>Access control is the first line of defense. Remember that you are a part of the security program. You should take appropriate action if you see anyone without an identification/access card in restricted areas as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Assess</strong> the situation: If you feel uncomfortable challenging a stranger alone, call security or ask a co-worker or supervisor to accompany you. <strong>Consider your own safety and donâ€™t hesitate to call security.</strong></li><li>Be vigilant when you notice strangers in your immediate work area; politely <strong>question</strong> them to ensure that they have a valid reason to be there.</li><li>If they are employees, ask them politely to show you their identification/access card.</li><li>If they are not employees, if it is safe to do so, <strong>accompany</strong> them to the meeting place or to the exit.</li><li>Remember, visitors must be properly escorted at all times (unless you have confirmed they are authorized to be without an escort in your facilities).<br></li><li>If a person refuses to accompany you to the exit, find a security representative or a manager and inform them of the situation; assess the situation and consider your own safety. <strong>Never physically intervene: call security.</strong><br></li></ul></div>
