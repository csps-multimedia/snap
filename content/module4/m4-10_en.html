You may also be asked to be more vigilant during periods of increased threat or heightened readiness.</p><p>Access controls are most effective when employees can be distinguished from other individuals. All employees are part of the security system and need to help ensure that only authorized individuals are provided access.</p><p>When access controls are not adequately applied, unauthorized individuals may be able to access restricted-areas, data, buildings, systems, and other assets to perform unauthorized activities which would otherwise be off limits to them.</p><p>This situation can lead to security incidents such as:</p><ul><li>Information leaks</li><li>Privacy breaches</li><li>Theft<br></li><li>Violence or harm to employees<br></li></ul></div>
