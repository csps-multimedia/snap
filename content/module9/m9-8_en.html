	<li>Tell others (family, spouse, friends) that you are working late and when you are expected to return.</li>
	<li>Don’t walk alone in the dark in unknown areas if you do not need to. Follow the safest route possible. Be alert and aware of your surroundings at all times.</li>
	<li>Avoid shortcuts and deserted areas; try to follow busy, well-lit streets after dark.</li>
	<li>If you have a mobile device, keep it handy for easy access to call 911. Avoid talking, texting or listening to music while you walk alone.</li>
	<li>If you suspect you are being followed, cross the street and go directly to the nearest populated area. If you continue to be followed, turn and in a loud voice say, “<strong>Stop following me.</strong>” Go to an occupied building or ask a taxi driver to call the police. <strong>Never be afraid to draw attention to the fact that you feel at risk.</strong></li>
	<li>If possible, arrange for an escort with building security to your vehicle or transit station.</li>
	<li>In elevators, look to see who's in the elevator before entering. If the occupants inside the elevator make you feel uncomfortable, wait for the next one. If a suspicious person enters the elevator, exit before the doors close. If something happens, push the emergency button on the panel.</li>
