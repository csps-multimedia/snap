	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-2"><p>Protecting employees from violence in the workplace is of critical importance and is the employer’s responsibility under the <em>Canada Labour Code</em><em>, Part II</em>. Although we do not normally go to work expecting violence to occur, it can happen and can have a serious impact on those affected, their families, and the workplace. </p><p>The <em>Policy on Government Security</em> makes references to the term “workplace violence.” Part XX of the <em>Occupational Health and Safety Regulations</em> defines workplace violence as: “any action, conduct, threat or gesture by a person towards an employee in their workplace that can reasonably be expected to cause harm, injury or illness to that employee.”<br></p></div>
