							<p>Travelers should:

									<li>know that foreign custom agents have the authority to ask for passwords to access electronic devices, at the risk of seizing it if traveller refuses</li>
									<li>never lose sight of bags and personal belongings; assume luggage will be searched</li>
									<li>never identify bags with business cards; keep occupation and nationality discreet</li>
									<li>continuously monitor local news channels and newspapers to assess the threat status in the local area and travel destinations</li>
									<li>always be mindful of elicitation techniques used by foreign agency officers and their agents </li>
									<li>always ensure travel documents, government information and assets are kept in a secure location
										<ul>
											<li>Never assume that hotel safes are secure: banks can provide a better alternative</li>
											<li>Assume that everything you communicate can be intercepted. Remember that even garbage can be information</li>
											<li>Never plug a portable storage device (that was given to you) into your computer, and never plug your own portable storage device into a foreign computer</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>whenever possible, refuse gifts: if the traveler must accept it, they should advise the Departmental Security Office immediately for guidance</li>
