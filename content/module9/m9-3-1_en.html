	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-9"><p>While an armed-intruder incident is highly unlikely, these attacks are becoming more common around the world, and federal government employees in Canada must be prepared to act if such an event occurs. As such, federal organizations should deliver staff information programs for armed-intruder incidents and conduct annual lockdown or shelter-in-place drills.</p>

<p>If ever you are faced with an armed-intruder incident, there are 3 things you can do that can help make a difference: <strong>RUN</strong>, <strong>HIDE</strong>, or <strong>DEFEND</strong>. It is important to note that these are options, NOT a series of steps; your options may change depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Visit the <a href="https://learn-apprendre.csps-efpc.gc.ca/application/en/content/armed-intruder-do-you-know-what-do" target=_blank>Armed Intruder</a> webpage on the School’s online learning platform (GCcampus) to learn more about how to prepare for such an event and to watch the Government of Canada training video, “Armed Intruder: Do You Know What To Do?”</p>
