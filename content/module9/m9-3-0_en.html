	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-2"><p>While TBS has decision-making authority for policy matters related to occupational health and safety (OHS) in the federal public service, departments and agencies are responsible for the development and establishment of a safety culture at work.</p>

<p>Good health and safety practices contribute to the objective of supporting the development of a high-performing workforce that provides good governance and service to Canadians.</p>

<p>It is every employerâ€™s responsibility to provide safe occupancy of the workplace and to prepare for emergencies and evacuations. TBS has developed a new Directive on Building Emergency and Evacuation Teams (BEET), which includes all types of hazards and events that could trigger emergency procedures. The directive:</p>

<ul>
	<li>addresses all potential hazards</li>
	<li>clarifies responsibilities and accountabilities in multi-tenants buildings</li>
	<li>addresses the information flow between the emergency and evacuation team, the workplace health and safety committees and other stakeholders</li>
	<li>ensures a consistent government-wide approach in preparing for emergencies and evacuations</li>
	<li>emphasizes the importance of training and exercise activities by requiring, at minimum, one annual evacuation drill and one non-evacuation exercise (lockdown or shelter-in-place) for all federal employees<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>TBS has also developed the Preparing for Emergencies and Evacuation of Buildings: A guide for federal departments, which provides useful information and tools to help organizations meet the objectives and requirements of the policy instruments.</p>
