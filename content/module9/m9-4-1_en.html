	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-2"><p>Government employees are often too quick to dismiss the notion that they could be targets. On the contrary, your perceived access to classified or privileged government information makes you an attractive target. As such, you are seen as a source of information by foreign intelligence services or operatives attempting to harvest that information or by domestic organized crime cells looking to gain access to government databases.</p>

<p>Many countries have sophisticated eavesdropping/intercept technologies capable of collecting the information we aim to protect, especially overseas.</p>

<p>Vigilance is necessary!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Points to keep in mind:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Canada and Canadians may be targets for hostile actors</li>
	<li>You donâ€™t get to determine whether you are worthy of targeting</li>
	<li>Be aware of your surroundings</li>
	<li>Never assume that no one is listening to your conversation, especially in public places</li>
	<li>Do not overlook the threat posed by thieves</li>
	<li>Be assertive! Be alert! Be aware!</li>
	<li>Report any suspicious activity</li>
</ul>
