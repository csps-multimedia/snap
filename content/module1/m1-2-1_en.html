<h1>Organization and Classification as a Discipline</h1>
      
<section class="col-md-8">

		<p>Organization and classification (<abbr>OC</abbr>) is referred to as the discipline practised by the classification community. Beyond the evaluation (classification) of positions and job responsibilities, the discipline includes providing expert advice on organizational structures and the content of job descriptions. This involves research and analysis to determine the best structure for the achievement of organizational objectives, and the provision of advice to management on the content of job descriptions to determine a positionâ€™s group, sub-group and level. </p>
		<p>Organization and classification as a discipline is position based rather than employee based. The work assigned to specific positions is articulated in job descriptions and evaluated by applying the occupational group and sub-group definitions and the appropriate job evaluation standards.</p>
		
		<h2>Financial Decisions </h2>
		<p><strong>Organization and classification </strong> will give rise to financial decisions that fall directly under the purview of the Financial Administration Act. Organizational design, job descriptions, and classification decisions provide management with the building blocks to fulfill their mandates and meet their business objectives. Organization and classification has a significant financial impact on the functioning of organizations because decisions around organizational structure, the content of a job description and the relative value of a position are linked to the creation of a hierarchy of work and a corresponding salary scale. </p>
