                    <p>Defining its mandate and establishing a budget are vital to an organization’s operations. Mandates are found in the acts, regulations and charters that govern an organization. The budget presents forecast revenues and expenditures (and full-time equivalents [FTEs]) that show how the organization will perform financially if certain strategies, events and plans are implemented.</p>

                <p>Roles and responsibilities are divided among positions that are related by an organizational structure. An organizational chart is usually used to illustrate the structure. 
To be successful, managers must implement a structure that will allow employees to contribute to the unit’s objectives. Although managers are responsible for organizational design, they are encouraged to consult an experienced <abbr>HR</abbr> advisor who can provide valuable advice on the various possible organizational structures and their implications for the classification of existing and future positions.

                    <p>Once all available information about a given job has been collected, it is summarized in a job description that is usually prepared by the manager. There are two types of job descriptions:  </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>	The unique job description, associated with a single position; </li>
                        <li>	The standardized job description, associated with several positions classified at the same occupational group and level.</li>
                    </ul>
            		<p>Once the job description content is properly linked to the organizational structure, the organization can more easily meet its mandate. The use of standardized job descriptions is supported by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat as an effective management practice and must be used wherever possible. </p>
