These requirements will be described in each of the modules throughout this course.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16578" target=_blank><em>Policy on Government Security</em> </a>stipulates how security should be managed within the federal government. This policy requires deputy heads to effectively manage security activities within their departments and to contribute to effective government-wide security management.</p>

<p>The policy is supported by the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32611" target=_blank><em>Directive on Security Management</em></a>, which outlines requirements for a departmental security program. A number of mandatory procedures and standards identify more detailed security requirements within specialized areas of security known as security controls. These security controls are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>security screening</li>
	<li>information technology security</li>
	<li>physical security</li>
	<li>business continuity management</li>
	<li>information management security</li>
	<li>security in contracts and other arrangements</li>
	<li>security event management</li>
	<li>security awareness and training</li>
</ul>
