<h1>External Links</h1>

<div class="col-md-12">    	
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>External links are quite simply links that lead to websites outside the course.</p>
    <p>Clicking on those links will open the website in a new window. There are different settings linked to how the window will open to be discussed with a developper.</p>
    <p>All links should be indexed properly in the Resources page to work.</p>

	<p>To access the list of index links, simply open the resources inside the toolbox.</p>
	<h2>Example</h2>

    <blockquote>When you want to find something, <a href="#" data-ext="ext-google">Google</a> is the place to go; it is thus an external website.</blockquote>
