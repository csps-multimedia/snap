<h1>Abbreviations</h1>

<div class="col-md-12">    	
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Abbreviations are word reductions and the full definition of the word must be available to someone who does not know its meaning.</p>
    <p>All abbreviations are indexed centrally in a file and are dynamically added to the pages where they are referenced.</p>
    <p>You can access the complete list of abbreviations for a course from the toolbox on the top bar and select "Resources".</p>

	<h2>Example</h2>

    <blockquote>Gross domestic product (<abbr>GDP</abbr>) is a monetary measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced in a period (quarterly or yearly) of time.</blockquote>
