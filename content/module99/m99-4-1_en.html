<h1>Glossary</h1>

<div class="col-md-12">	
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The Glossary is where all terms are defined for the learner: new words, specific terminology, interesting concepts, etc.</p>
    <p>This can be used to assist the learning in progressing through the course while learning new terminology without breaking the pace of the course, offering an optional, contextual, resource as the learner reads through the content</p>

	<p>Each of those words or expressions are defined and kept together in a centralized place in alphabetical order. The terms are sorted by letter for ease of use and accessed inside a lightbox popup to be able to remain on the content page you were using.</p>

	<p>You can access the entire glossary from the toolbox in the top bar menu and select 'glossary'.</p>
    <p>All words that are linked to the glossary are listed there and changes made to the main list will affect the entire course.</p>

	<h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Once all the terms and definitions have been indexed in the glossary, it is possible to reference them from within the course content:</p>
    <blockquote>It has been found to be easy to <a href="#glossary_Verify" class="csps-glossary">verify</a> how the glossary reacts when called from the page content, by clicking on the link within this sentence.</blockquote>
