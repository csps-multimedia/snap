	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-6"><p>It is important that appropriate security safeguards be taken. A recently published policy implementation notice on the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/modern-emerging-technologies/policy-implementation-notices/secure-use-portable-data-storage-devices-government.html" target=_blank>Secure Use of Portable Storage Devices</a> introduces a number of stringent security requirements. Departments and agencies will train employees on the proper use of portable storage devices and the associated security tools. Users will be required to sign a portable storage device user agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Some of the security requirements for portable storage devices are as follows: </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Portable storage devices must be physically secured (not attached to your lanyard), at all times, as appropriate to the highest level of security classification of the information stored on it</li>
	<li>Portable storage devices must be labelled to indicate the highest classification level of information that has been stored on the device</li>
	<li>When transporting a portable storage device with government information stored on it, you must keep it under your constant control and possession at all times</li>
	<li>Employees must only use devices that have been approved and issued by their department for storage of government information</li>
	<li>Portable storage devices are intended for the temporary storage of information only and must not be used as permanent document repositories</li>
	<li>All government information stored on portable storage devices must be encrypted</li>
</ul>

<p>When travelling abroad, it is critical that users be particularly vigilant in exercising recommended security controls. Those who have potentially sensitive information on their devices may want to consider having them specially configured for travel to minimize the risks and potential access to their sensitive information. Contact your departmental security office or IT security services for more information.</p>
