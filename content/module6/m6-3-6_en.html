	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-2"><p>Many employees mistakenly believe that when they delete data, it is gone for good. You should be aware that this data can be easily recovered from almost any device.</p>

<p>Many business tools we use have the capability to store information, including desktop and laptop computers, faxes, printers, photocopiers, and smartphones.</p>

<p>Consult with your help desk or IT security staff on the proper procedures for the disposal or reuse of electronic storage devices.</p>

<p>Each department must have procedures and processes in place to ensure that information is properly sanitized from electronic devices. Sanitizing or clearing electronic storage devices refers to secure methods for preventing data recovery. In some cases, depending on the device, there may be a need to physically destroy the device to ensure the information contained on the media is not recoverable.</p>
