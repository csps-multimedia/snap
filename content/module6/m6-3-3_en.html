	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-2"><p>Our increasing dependence on electronic forms of communication carries with it the increased risk posed by accidental disclosure of sensitive information. E-mail is also easily intercepted and often exploited to attack our systems and networks.<br></p><p>E-mail and e-mail with file attachments are among the most common sources of malicious code. The malicious software code is often embedded in common attachments like PDFs and other electronic documents, as well as Web links.</p><p>It is crucial that all employees maintain a high level of cyber awareness and scrutinize all e-mails before opening them. If you receive a suspicious e-mail, <strong>do not reply, do not click on any links, and do not open the attachments</strong>. Instead, copy down the relevant details (e-mail address, subject line, time received, etc.) and report the incident to your help desk or IT security staff as soon as possible.</p><p>Select the following job-aids for more information:</p><ul><li><a title="Indicators of Malicious Emails" class="wb-lbx" id="wb-auto-113" href="#LOM_el_4_lbx" data-cke-saved-href="#LOM_el_4_lbx">Indicators of Malicious Emails</a><br></li><li><a title="Examples of Email Attacks" class="wb-lbx" id="wb-auto-114" href="#LOM_el_5_lbx" data-cke-saved-href="#LOM_el_5_lbx">Examples of Email Attacks</a><br></li></ul></div>

	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-6"><p>A number of confirmed cyber-attacks in the government are so-called “spear phishing” e-mails. These are malicious e-mails that are addressed to a specific user and appear to be legitimate because the subject line is relevant, the message is pertinent, and/or the sender is known. You have to be very careful because it is harder to detect that these e-mails contain malicious attachments or links. </p><p>Make sure you really know who is sending the e-mail, that the tone is consistent for the sender, and that the content is really relevant to your work. </p><p>“Spam” refers to unsolicited bulk e-mails sent with the hopes of enticing recipients to buy something or provide sensitive information. Never click on a link or open an attachment. To safeguard against spam, protect your e-mail address: do NOT post your government e-mail address online or use it when filling out electronic forms for non-government matters, as per your department’s acceptable use guidelines.<br></p></div>
