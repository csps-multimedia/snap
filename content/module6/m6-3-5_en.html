	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-2"><p>Passwords provide a simple, direct means of protecting a system or account. Using proper passwords is the first line of defense against intruders.<br></p><p>Passwords are generally used in combination with some form of identification, such as a user name, account number or e-mail address. The user name establishes the identity of the user. The password is a word, a phrase or combination of miscellaneous characters which is known only to the user. The password authenticates the identity of the user.</p><p>You are accountable for all actions taken under your user name and password: this is your electronic identity. Never share your password with anyone!</p><p>Be sure to use different passwords for different accounts. For example, never use the same passwords for your work or bank accounts as your personal accounts like Facebook, YouTube or Twitter.</p><p>While passwords are a vital component of system security, they can be cracked or broken relatively easily. You need to select proper passwords in accordance with departmental password policies.</p><p><br></p><p><a class="wb-lbx" href="#LOM_el_4_lbx" data-cke-saved-href="#LOM_el_4_lbx">Tips for Creating Passwords</a><br></p></div>
