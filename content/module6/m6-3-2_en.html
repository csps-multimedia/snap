The attacker attempts to trick an individual for the purpose of information gathering, fraud or system access. Social engineering is often one of many steps in a more complex scheme to gain access to electronic resources, data or personal information. It is often associated with identity theft, fraudulent activities, cybercrime or espionage.</p><p>Never disclose personal information unless you are certain that the requesting individual is not an imposter and that he/she has a legitimate need to know for business purposes.</p><p>Most of the social engineering attempts are done through eâ€‘mail, but victims have also been targeted by a combination of phone and e-mail.</p><p><a class="wb-lbx link-as-button" href="#LOM_el_5_lbx" data-cke-saved-href="#LOM_el_5_lbx">Examples</a></p></div>
