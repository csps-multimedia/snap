They may range from violations of departmental or government policy, to a criminal act. The impact may be local, could affect multiple departments, or could involve a threat to national security. An event may be simple (e.g. a single cause) or complex (e.g. multi-stage coordinated attack).</p><p>Security events&nbsp;may originate internally or externally, and can be caused deliberately or accidentally. A compromise can occur when individuals fail to adequately protect information or assets under their control, or when an individual accesses sensitive information without the authority to do so.</p></div>
