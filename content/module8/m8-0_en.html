As an employee, <strong>YOU</strong> provide the “eyes and ears” on the ground to ensure that your workplace is secure. If you suspect a security event, report it!</p><h3>Objectives</h3><p>At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p><ul><li>recognize a security event</li><li>summarize how to report a security event</li></ul></div>
