Your departmental security services can review the checklist prior to any formal contracting being initiated and provide additional guidance.</p><p>Departments must use the checklist to define the security requirements for contracts for which PSPC is the contracting authority. Departments should also use the checklist or similar processes for contracts for which they are the contracting authority. If the checklist is not being used, departments should provide written assurance if there are no security requirements, by certifying such on the actual requisition/contract.</p></div>
