	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-3"><p><strong>Key Message</strong></p><p>It is extremely important to report security incidents immediately because a security incident could cause a significant injury to government operations, individuals or other organizations. Security incidents involving sensitive personal information could cause harm or embarrassment detrimental to the individual's career, reputation, financial position, safety, health or well-being. The sooner the incident is discovered and reported, the more likely it is that the injury can be prevented or minimized.<br></p></div>
