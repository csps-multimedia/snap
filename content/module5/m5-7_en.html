<p>All sensitive hardcopy information should be disposed of using approved shredders.</p>

<h3>Electronic Media</h3>

<p>Computers and electronic media including disk drives, laptops, fax machines, BlackBerry’s, photocopiers as well as portable media such as USB keys, hard drives and CDs must be “sanitized and/or destroyed” using approved methods before they are disposed of or reused in a different security environment. It is not enough to simply delete or erase the files because the data can still be recovered.</p>

<p>Special processes are in place within each department for the sanitization of portable storage devices. Contact your IT security personnel for guidance on properly disposing of electronic Media.</p>
