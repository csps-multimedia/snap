    <h2>The Classification Program</h2>
    <p>The Policy on Classification defines the <a href="#class_pr" class="csps-glossary">Classification Program</a> as the infrastructure for the effective management and control of the classification of positions in the <a href="#pub_admin" class="csps-glossary">Core Public Administration (<abbr title="" data-oldtitle="Core Public Administration">CPA</abbr>)</a>. Its key components include policies, directives, classification standards, <a href="#occ_group" class="csps-glossary">occupational group</a> definitions, <a href="#job_desc" class="csps-glossary">job descriptions</a>, <a href="#job_eval" class="csps-glossary">job evaluation standards</a>, active <a href="#monitoring" class="csps-glossary">monitoring</a>, and grievance mechanisms. </p>
    <p>The goal of the Classification program is to establish the relative value of all work in the <a href="#pub_admin" class="csps-glossary">core public administration</a> in an equitable, consistent, efficient and effective manner, and to provide a basis for the compensation of public service employees. </p>
    <p>To this end, the Classification program defines the occupational groups and <a href="#level" class="csps-glossary">levels</a> using job evaluation standards to assign a relative value to the work done by the positions. </p>
    <p>Here is the current Occupational group structure as defined by the Treasury Board.</p>
    <p>The discipline practised by the Classification community is often called “organization and classification” (<abbr title="" data-oldtitle="organization and classification">OC</abbr>) because, in addition to evaluating (classifying) <a href="#position" class="csps-glossary">positions</a>, it also involves a review and modelling of an <a href="#organisation" class="csps-glossary">organization</a> based on a set of parameters (mandate, business objectives, budget, resources, etc.), in order to develop the optimum organizational structure that will enable the manager or the organization to deliver its mandate.</p>

      <summary class="wb-details">Organization</summary>
      <p>In the context of the <abbr title="" data-oldtitle="Core Public Administration">CPA</abbr>, organization refers to the alignment of an organization’s activities with the roles and responsibilities mandated by Parliament and reflecting government priorities. It is achieved through a process of review, research and modelling, called <a href="#org_des" class="csps-glossary">organizational design</a>, to help managers establish an optimal structure to meet defined objectives and mandates.</p>

      <summary class="wb-details">Classification</summary>
      <p>Classification is a process by which the relative value of work in the <abbr title="" data-oldtitle="Core Public Administration">CPA</abbr> is determined, resulting in an appropriate occupational group and level. This is done by analyzing the content of the job description, the organizational context and relativity, while adhering to the requirements of the Treasury Board Policy on Classification and related instruments.</p>
      <p>Classification supports the development of coherent <a href="#org_struct" class="csps-glossary">organizational structures</a> and work relationships and forms the framework for effective resourcing, labour relations, training, performance management, and effective management, planning and use of human resources within an organization.</p>
