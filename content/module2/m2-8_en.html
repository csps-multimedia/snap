	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-2"><p>There is no such thing as perfect security: security is all about managing risks.</p><p>Few employees are actually involved in assessing security risks and selecting and implementing appropriate security measures.</p><p>Security risk management is the responsibility of program managers and security professionals. The aim is to ensure that security supports priorities, plans and programs within each department.</p><p>However, security is everyoneâ€™s business. All employees should understand how important security is to their business. You should be aware of what is going on around you, and if you see security weaknesses, poor security procedures or if security is being ignored you should tell your manager or departmental security office.</p></div>
