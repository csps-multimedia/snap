	<li><strong>Deliberate threats</strong> are caused by humans who may act individually or as part of a larger group or organization. Some examples of deliberate threat actors include:
	<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
		<li><strong>Individuals</strong> – Individuals, working either inside or outside of the Government of Canada, can be a threat. Examples include:
		<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
			<li>individual criminal act for financial gain: break-in or theft of a valuable asset or sensitive information</li>
			<li>defacing a website for “bragging rights”</li>
			<li>insider sabotage in reaction to a perceived injustice (e.g. deleting files after receiving a layoff notice)</li>
			<li>an employee accessing personal information held by the government for personal curiosity or benefit</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Groups or Collectives</strong> – Certain groups, generally motivated by socio-political or religious concerns, can be a threat to the Government of Canada. Examples include:
		<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
			<li>acts of protest, activism, and civil disobedience</li>
			<li>acts of terrorism</li>
			<li>disrupting access to computer systems, websites and networks through so-called “denial of service attacks”</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Organized Crime</strong> – Organized criminals are primarily motivated by financial gain but generally have more capability to cause harm than individuals. For example, some organized crime groups have the resources necessary to bribe or coerce employees into wrongdoing. Examples include:
		<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
			<li>theft of personal information (identity theft)</li>
			<li>fraud</li>
			<li>unauthorized access to law enforcement information</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Industry and Foreign Governments</strong> – Industry (e.g. corporations, businesses) and foreign governments are a potential source of threat to the Government of Canada when they are motivated to engage in industrial or economic espionage. These entities seek intellectual property, trade secrets, insight into negotiations, etc. that may give them a national or global economic advantage in the long term. Examples include:
		<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
			<li>Computer attacks to gain access to proprietary information.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Foreign Intelligence Services</strong> – Foreign Intelligence Services are generally motivated by a national mandate to seek access to the sensitive information of other nations. Examples include:
		<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
			<li>intrusions to gain access to national security or classified military information</li>
			<li>electronic eavesdropping</li>
			<li>recruiting insiders</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left: 96px;">Foreign states, organized crime and terrorist groups are actively using espionage, via the use of insiders, to gain access to sensitive Government of Canada information.</p>

<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>Accidental threats</strong> include acts such as human error or omissions, office accidents, software errors or failures, equipment failures, mechanical failures, structural failures, industrial accidents, or nuclear accidents. Some examples include:

	<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
		<li>careless handling or improper disposing of classified material that could result in accidental disclosures</li>
		<li>lost laptops or mobile devices containing personal information that could be accessed</li>
		<li>software errors that cause system outages that disrupt service delivery. For example a bad software patch led to a lengthy outage of an online service to Canadians.</li>
		<li>in 2003, a widespread electric outage affected an estimated 10 million people in Ontario and disrupted government operations. The blackout was caused by a software bug in the alarm system and it cascaded into a widespread outage on the electric grid through a combination of operator errors.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Natural hazards</strong> are threats that arise from naturally occurring phenomena. Natural hazards can be grouped into geophysical events, meteorological events, and disease-related events:
	<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
		<li><strong>Geological:</strong> Earthquakes and tsunami are examples of a geological threat that can cause major damage. In Canada, they are more likely to occur near the Pacific coast.</li>
		<li><strong>Meteorological:</strong> Floods, ice storms and extreme temperatures are common examples of meteorological threats facing our various institutions. Extreme weather events such as flooding are an increasing concern.</li>
		<li><strong>Disease:</strong> SARS and H1N1 are examples of infectious disease epidemic/pandemic that can affect our employees.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
