	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-11"><p>Government of Canada systems and networks may be targeted by a wide variety of threat actors looking to steal government information. These attackers typically gain access by targeting users with malicious e-mails that appear to be legitimate. Some network attacks are sophisticated and may remain undetected for a long period of time. How to spot malicious e-mail messages will be covered in more depth in later modules; however, the following <a href="https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/spotting-malicious-email-messages-itsap00100" target=_blank>Spotting Malicious E-mail Messages - Guidance for the Government of Canada</a> will provide some tips.</p></div>

Individuals holding senior positions within government and/or those who work with valuable information may be at higher risk. Adversaries have the capability to target electronic devices or may monitor networks, hotels or business centres to obtain sensitive information. In later modules, we will discuss best practices in keeping yourself and government devices safe while travelling.</p>

If you have proprietary information, then your greatest threat might be unauthorized access by business competitors. (e.g. PSPC, Receiver General, Service Canada, any department receiving proprietary information from businesses as part of a regulatory function or scientific work, e.g. Health Canada, Agriculture Canada, Natural Resources Canada, National Research Council, etc.).</p>

Criminal activity such as identity theft may be a primary concern, but unauthorized access to personal information (e.g. tax information of individuals) or accidental disclosure through mishandling of portable media may also be of concern (e.g. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, Service Canada, Passport Canada, Canada Revenue Agency, Veterans Affairs Canada).</p></div>
